Regarding the python setup,
personal preference goes to using anaconda.
For details of anaconda,
go to [anaconda install page](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).

To run this project, first make sure that python version is 3.x.
Second, make sure the following packages are installed:
`bs4`, `pandas`, `xlsxwriter`.
`bs4` has BeautifulSoup that parses webpages.
`pandas` has utilities that help to write to excel files.
`xlsxwriter` is the engine used by pandas to write to excel files.

If the python is installed along with anaconda, then run
```
conda install <package-name>
```

If any of the above mentioned packages are uninstalled, run the following command:
```
sudo pip install <package-name>
```
The `pip` command requires admin privilege
so if prompted for passwords, just enter it.
